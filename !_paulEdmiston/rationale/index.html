		<p>Good design is like a good suit: you don't <em>technically</em> need it, but it'll get you a whole lot farther than you would without it. </p>
		<p>I got into design because I love good design. I suppose I got my interests in art and design started at an early age. I have no shame these days in admitting I got my first exposure to art and design by frequenting DeviantArt and tinkering with little games in the likes of Roblox and Nationstates. Seeing the cream of the crop rise up then—a fair chunk of them people that were presumably around my age, give or take—was pretty inspiring. "If these sorts can get a leg up, I bet there's a nonzero chance I could." </p>
		<p>Did I get popular in any of those early days? Nah, not really. But I <em>would</em> say I got my chops there with an early start. </p>
		<p>Things kinda snowballed from there. My interests in that stuff from the sideline had me seeking out ways I can explore that academically by middle school. By high school I was helping wrangle the school branding system and seeking out district wide competitions. Towards the end of my senior year, I decided that a career in design would be my kind of fit. My high school computer graphics professor pointed me in the right direction for where to take my higher education, and here we are now. </p>
		<p class="emSpace">Why did I get into design? I dunno. I suppose I was "always" into it, and I suppose seeing things done well scratches an itch mighty fine. I get my fair share of moments where me working in design feels like a hand in a well fit glove. Either way, I'm glad it worked out the way it has. </p>

		<p>I'm not a fan at pinpointing inspirations. I'd suppose I aim to take inspiration these days from a diverse range. That said, it's interesting to try and see what comes to mind. </p>
		<p>I think the bulk of my design inspiration comes from the likes of Saul Bass, Paul Rand, and Massimo Vignelli. I appreciate design that gets its strength not from flourishes, but rather in its core representation and form. The sort of strong design that anyone can appreciate and be drawn to, maybe even be proud of. The sort of designs that are strong foundations at their start that, no matter how they're ultimately dressed up, they'll be strong where it counts. </p>
		<p>My willingness to dress up where it's desireable is why I'm really hesitant to concretely pinpoint my inspirations. It feels restrictive, like I have to directly play into the hand I'm dealt or something. I like to leave my options open, dress for the occasion. I suppose I get a fair degree of inspiration from design in the culture I'm immersed in. I love to consume the culture I encounter: reading, watching movies, whatever comes my way I love to get into it, I love to appreciate it, and I love to ask "how did they do it?" Sometimes that stuff is floaty high thinking stuff. Sometimes that's a shoot-em-up video game. </p>
		<p>Again, I keep my options open. </p>
