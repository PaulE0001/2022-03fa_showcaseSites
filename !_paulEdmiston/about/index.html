			<p>Oh snap! Get me some copy from my primary site STAT!</p>
			<p>I'm Paul Edmiston! I hope you got that by now with my name practically everywhere around here!</p>
			<p>For as long as I can remember my passions have been focused on art and design, but it wasn't until high school that I started to zero in on the idea of doing it as a career. Since then I have been reaching for opportunities around me to work in the craft and make a look that stands out as thorough and sharp.</p>
			<p>I have focused on my studies as of late. I just recently transferred from DVC to SF State. I'm focused in Graphic Design and front end web development, but as a major in Visual Communications, I'm a flexible designer capable to work with whatever comes my way.</p>
