		<p class="subtitle">Wait, how did you get here?</p>
		<img class="doodle" src="_images/wipsplash.png" alt="Pictured: A cartoon illustration of Paul Edmiston signing an OK symbol, grossly bastardized in the form of emojis." width="400">
		<p>Better yet, how did <em>I</em> get here?</p>
		<p>Pretty early on in the DES roadmap, for both VCD and IND I'm pretty sure, is DES300. My professor had us take on a project that involved sewing. A lot of it. It was my first proper experience with a sewing machine.</p>
		<p>To put it as gracefully as possible, it was excruciating and kicked me in an academic tardy hole I'm just barely beginning to dig myself out of.</p>
		<p>Do I mention that for pity? Good grief, no, but it's pretty good tool to make a point.</p>
		<p class="emSpace">Sneaking this project in the backdoor as part of my effort to dig myself out of said hole, despite only realizing in the midst of doing so that could've put an irreversible damper on my grade, gave me the chance to prepare for a critique question that seems to be consistently coming up: "If you had a bigger skillset, what would you have included in this site?" Now honestly because my pride demands I don't give the whole spiel verbally, chances are high I'll give an abridged version when the time comes to pass. This page is a neat opportunity to expand on that further.</p>

		<p>At least in my circumstance, I don't really think "a bigger skillset" is the bottleneck here. I know I have a long ways to go before, I dunno, Silicon Valley Rockstar or something, but to my credit, I consider myself well adapted digitally. This sorta stuff comes fairly easy to me, and when it doesn't, I'm pretty well suited to being resourceful and figuring out how to leverage resources when it comes to getting the knowledge.</p>
		<p>But what I <em>don't</em> have is time. I can already say I'm taking a reduced schedule because I know I prioritize building a time balance between my academics and literally everything else, even if that means spreading it out over a longer span of time. Yet even with that cushioning, one awry project was enough of a wrench in my system to break my roll for nearly a month. Not only does that sort of thing hurt me in the academics, I feel it hurts me in the reputation. Here's these people coming in an out with a standard issue load in two years and they get out relatively without a scratch? A yikes from me, dog.</p>
		<p>It's the sort of issue that it feels like no amount of BuJo or pomodoro timers can resolve, and believe me I've tried them before. No, it doesn't directly answer the question of "If you had a bigger skillset what would you have included," but I hope it sheds some light on where I really feel I'm struggling. It ain't skillset, it ain't a single class being too much or too little. It's the whole lot taking too long. There's only 24 hours in a day and even less of them are waking hours.</p>
		<p>Between you and me, I'm inclined to at the least stick with my gut and continue my four class, 12 unit load. But honestly, despite what seems to be ample protest from professors when the idea comes up, I'm inclined to push that to three classes, 9 units. That worked for me substantially well in DVC, and if I can carry it over to SF State with minimal consequences aside from the time span, I could dig that just fine.</p>
