		# META TAG EXPLANATIONS
		None of these will be test material, but they have some interesting functions.

		1. Sets the Character Set to 8-bit unicode. Specifying this is *usually* not required, as there's a lot of redundancy in place to help you out if you don't know to/forget to. But it's good and common practice. That said:
			a. Not including it typically only yields problems in circumstances past the microsite project.
			b. Explaining it's point to a substantial degree opens a big heaping can of Technical that we didn't have the time for. 
			c. You don't need to really know about it unless you're deep in the weeds. 
		So no way in Hell would I expect you to have included it personally. Brownie points if you did, though.
		All that said, it's good practice, and I feel it's best to keep it there. <:)


		2. Remember when I said I'd try to hide your pages from search engines? This is what does that.

		3. So this one is weird. The best way I can tell you why I included this is to see a visual example.

		Summed up, page scaling on phones has a habit of getting strange. This meta tag resolves this.

			<h3>A pleasure to have you</h3>
			<p>Whew! It certainly took a hot minute overtime to get this out, and I sincerely thank you for your patience with this. It's been a mighty busy weekend, trust me.</p>
			<p>What follows is an online showcase of this section's microsite projects.</p>


			<section>
				<h4>Recommendations</h4>
				<p>So what can or should you do with this showcase? Well, there's nothing you're required to do with it, but if you'd like some pointers to explore further, I have a few that immediately come to mind.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><p><strong>Look around!</strong> Everyone did a solid job on this project and there are so many goodies to consider in every submission. Maybe you'd like to take a closer look at how one student chose to lay out their structure. Or maybe another student did something neat under-the-hood that you'd like to inspect. There's something insightful to be found in every page. Related to that&#8230;</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Look under the hood!</strong> Sure, a fine coat of paint does a site good, but now's a chance to take a peek at how the sausage is made. Try opening Devtools in other projects and examining how your classmates did something that catches your eye. Or maybe you'll find hidden secrets. Who knows what you might find?</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Break a page!</strong> Our presentations showed your pages in the best circumstances, and this will be the baseline we grade your pages at. But of course, we look at websites on more than just a desktop widescreen. Try taking a webpage down to a smaller screen and see what still works and what doesn't. If you're feeling it, a lot of Devtools come with the ability to simulate poor internet connection. See what remains quick to load and what ends up taking a hot minute.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h4>Common pitfalls</h4>
				<p>It's tough to get everything just right, and just about impossible to get dead-on perfect. I noticed a few common mistakes across the board that may be worthwhile to collectively address. We might not be doing much in the way of HTML/CSS for the rest of this course, but if you're interested in pursuing it further on your own time, you may want to be aware of what's mentioned here.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><p><strong></strong></p></li>
				</ul>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h4>Common Successes</h4>
				<p>That said, there's plenty that many of you did that's well worth highlighting! You may want to keep these in mind as habits you'd like to continue.</p>

				<ul>

				<h4>Project closing remarks</h4>
				<p>I know from first-hand experience that web design can be plenty far from easy. It can be a challenge, especially when you're starting out and you only have a bit more than a month to push out a product. But it's all the more reason that I mean it when I say y'all did great here. Not only have you made some well-built and attractive pieces, but you managed it with the time we have. That's not something to be understated.</p>
				<p>The good thing about web design, if you choose to pursue it, is that things get a bit easier with experience. Sure, there'll always be something new one step ahead, but you'll get the hang of the foundation. You might not have the precise syntax or convention memorized to a T (and quite frankly, no one human can,) but you'll come to have an acute awareness of the general principles. You'll gain a sense of what's possible with what and a general sense of what you need to look for to find out how to do it. With time and experience, something like this will become easier and faster for you to dish out.</p>
				<p>Once again, well done to those of you that have completed this project. This and the midterm just about caps off the HTML/CSS portion of this course &#128079;.</p>

				<h4>FAQ</h4>
			<ol id="faq">
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;Wait but why?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>Admittedly it's a bit uncommon and a bit extra, both from what I know here at SF State and my own experiences in these sorts of classes elsewhere. There are at least a couple of good reasons to try it out, though.</p>

					<ol>
						<li><p><strong>You can see your classmates' work for itself.</strong> A strong part of both web design and interactive design as a whole is the collaborative aspect of it. Design in general is a collaborative process, but digital work really lends itself toward it. There's a sort of transparency to it that's kind of required. We might not always be able to see a brand's Style Guidelines or a poster's Illustrator file, but we can just about always see a webpage's markup and programming. There's indeed plenty of proprietary software and services in the mix, but the backbone of the web is built on code and framing directly provided to the world, free of charge and free for copy and modification.</p>
						<p>Put simply, the web builds on itself, both aesthetically and digitally. I'd like for you to have the opportunity to take a closer look at what makes these projects tick.</p></li>

						<li><p><strong>It's fun.</strong> It's a relatively low-stakes web exercise for me and it's a nice opportunity for you to look around in more detail at what students have made. I can see that each and every one of you put in a solid effort towards your work and that's something worth being proud of and showing off. There's also something much more satisfying about seeing your web work <em>actually</em> on the web rather than just sitting around in a thumb drive.</p></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;Wait a minute, is it just me or is the order randomized?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>That ain't just you, it's randomized. Or hopefully it is.</p>
					<p>I get the feeling there's a natural tendency to prioritize items right at the start, right at the end, and <em>maybe</em> right on the middle if you're feeling generous. That leaves swathes of content often disregarded, and that's unfortunate. So inside the JavaScript for this page is a bit of code that should randomize the order to a respectable degree.</p>
					<p>It should change on each refresh, try it out!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;Have you made any modifications to my work?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>No changes are made to your design or the grand majority of your code. For all intents and purposes, your work is presented as-is. That said, you may want to know that three distinct changes have been made for technical reasons:</p>

					<ol>
						<li><p><strong><code>noindex</code>:</strong> A <code>noindex</code> meta tag is added to the head of your pages. This is what keeps your pages from being indexed on search engines.</p></li>
						<li><p><strong>(At least) most of your links should be fixed:</strong> If there were any issues with your links, they have been resolved. This is to allow you and your classmates to explore your microsites without hinderance. This isn't a guarantee that I caught <em>every</em> link, however. Don't expect for this to mean you're off the hook for link issues in your grade, either &#128586;.</p>
						<p><sup>You might be interested in taking note of <em>how</em> they were changed, however. That's about as much as I can directly say or do	&#128584;.</sup></p></li>
						<li><p><strong>A folder of showcase assets is added:</strong> This includes a button image and a configuration file. This allows the process of button generation to be at least somewhat automated.</p></li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;How long will this showcase be up?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>This will be up for the whole semester and then a bit more. More precisely, this site will be taken offline by the start of the 2023 Spring semester. Put simply, I need the digital real estate, too, and I like to attach expiries on content that isn't really mine. Feels only proper to do so.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;But I'd like to look at it until the Heat Death or something. Any way I can do that?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>If that really interests you, let me or Trevor know and I'm sure we can work out something that either involves <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the Wayback Machine</a> or distributing a zip. I'd rather hold off on that though at least until the time comes. We'll Burn That Bridge When We Get There.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;I added a resubmission. May you update my microsite?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>Of course! I'll be doing that automatically in fact if I spot it. I can mention updates in a weekly announcement if you'd like, too, but I won't be doing that unless asked to. I'd rather keep your inboxes light if I can help it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;My microsite isn't showing up and I want it to! What happened and what can you do?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>There's most likely an issue with how I set up shop. I might have forgot an important file or set up a function incorrectly. Just let me know and I'll look into it ASAP.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;You confirmed with me that you updated my microsite, but it doesn't look like you did. What's up with that?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>It might take a moment for the web server to reflect changes, but the more likely culprit is that <a href="https://refreshyourcache.com/en/cache/">you need to do a force refresh or clear the site from your browser's cache.</a> This is a common speedbump to encounter in web design when you're working with a server.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;I'd rather have my content taken down sooner rather than later. May you do that?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>Yes. This is a totally optional bit and if you'd prefer to not participate in it, I for one won't ask any questions. Just let either me or Trevor know and I'll remove your microsite from circulation.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<blockquote>&#8220;Will you be doing showcases like this for the other projects?&#8221;</blockquote>
					<p>Maybe. HTML/CSS especially benefit from seeing them on a live server. p5.js has enough technical parts to it that it may be beneficial to at least gather it all up in a single place, too. Our UI/UX portion? Perhaps? That can be a lot more reliant on local files, especially depending on your prototyping software.</p>
					<p>If this was appreciated and you'd like to see it for the other projects, let me or Trevor know and I'll definitely continue it.</p>
					<p>On the bright side, now that I've set up shop, it'll be profoundly faster and easier to roll out another one &#129396;.</p>
